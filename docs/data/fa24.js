Frequent exercises will produce multiple films and images, while a long term collaborative midterm and an independent final project will offer sustained concentration on a theme and development."]}, "sort": ["Animation", "2000", 2]}, {"_index": "portal-production__wddata_wdsection_wegdhlx", "_type": "wddata_noauthwdsection", "_id": "wddata_noauthwdsection:11079", "_score": null, "_source": {"pk": "11079", "content_type": ["wddata.NoAuthWDSection"], "get_meetings": ["Mon/Thu 4:00-07:00PM, (Future) Main Bldg - 124"], "get_meeting_times": ["Mon/Thu 4:00-07:00PM"], "_get_instructors": ["Craig Good"], "get_colocated_sections": [], "get_url": "/courses/sec/ANIMA-2100-1_AP_Fall_2024/", "get_subject": "Animation", "get_campus_filter": "San Francisco", "get_location_filter": "In-Person/San Francisco", "get_term_filter": "Fall 2024", "get_start_windows_filter": ["12pm \u2014 5:59pm"], "_get_instructors_filter": ["Craig Good"], "_get_instructor_profile_usernames_filter": ["good"], "get_instructor_avatar_urls_filter": ["https://portal-media.cca.edu/avatars/good/avatar_cropped_1579818447_thumb.jpg"], "get_subject_filter": "Animation", "get_acad_level_filter": "Undergraduate", "get_course_number_filter": "2100", "get_section_description_filter": "This course is an introduction to the methods and tools of storytelling.

The ways in which systems in nature leverage simple operations to build, grow and re-build are being studied by biologists and mathematicians to understand these modular logics; these logics can be applied to new strategies for building embedded in material and resource efficiency. This elective will begin by looking to some of this research to rethink the architectural component and its relationship to natural systems. We will also investigate formal precedents in the natural world at multiple scales for both formal approaches and materials that are low in embodied energy. This aligns with efforts in building sciences to re-consider current building materials high in embodied carbon. As participants of the Biodesign Challenge held yearly in New York City, the process will involve material exploration into biomaterials and novel composite approaches that can be both speculative and grounded in scientific understanding. We will partner with graduate students from UCSF as science consultants, as well as become familiar with methods to calculate the embodied carbon in building materials. The focus of this semester\u2019s work will be to research and consider biomaterials and its embodied carbon as we design components for an architectural facade. Each team will build a partial full-scale prototype of this system to be exhibited at the spring 2025 CCA (AEL/DCL)/ Autodesk Technology Center Academic Alliance | 5th Annual Biomaterials in Architecture and Design Symposium."]}, "sort": ["Architecture", "5400", 1]}, {"_index": "portal-production__wddata_wdsection_wegdhlx", "_type": "wddata_noauthwdsection", "_id": "wddata_noauthwdsection:11155", "_score": null, "_source": {"pk": "11155", "content_type": ["wddata.NoAuthWDSection"], "get_meetings": ["Fri 12:00-03:00PM, (Future) Main Bldg - E5"], "get_meeting_times": ["Fri 12:00-03:00PM"], "_get_instructors": ["Irene C Cheng"], "get_colocated_sections": ["MARCH-6500-1: HT: History/Theory Elective (Material Histories)"], "get_url": "/courses/sec/ARCHT-5500-1_AP_Fall_2024/", "get_subject": "Architecture", "get_campus_filter": "San Francisco", "get_location_filter": "In-Person/San Francisco", "get_term_filter": "Fall 2024", "get_start_windows_filter": ["12pm \u2014 5:59pm"], "_get_instructors_filter": ["Irene C Cheng"], "_get_instructor_profile_usernames_filter": ["icheng"], "get_instructor_avatar_urls_filter": ["https://portal-media.cca.edu/avatars/icheng/avatar_cropped_1689311398_thumb.jpg"], "get_subject_filter": "Architecture", "get_acad_level_filter": "Undergraduate", "get_course_number_filter": "5500", "get_section_description_filter": "This is a vertical elective combining students in their fourth and fifth year of the BArch program with students from the architecture graduate programs.

The Mock-Up will culminate as an environmental object to test and display the \u201cmaking-with\u201d--meaning not just reconfiguring the relation of contractor and architect, but also human and non-human.

Along the way, the class will examine differing ideas about prisons as sites of rehabilitation and reform, deterrence and/or punishment as well as investigate movements to abolish prison entirely.Critical Ethnic Studies 2000-level seminars introduce students to the complexities and nuances of intersectionality, gender, disability, decolonial theory &amp; philosophy, in imperialist and non-imperialist societies. 2000-level seminars may incorporate one or more of the following interdisciplinary fields of critical ethnic studies:  Africana studies, African-American Studies, Asian American studies, Indigenous studies, Chicano/a /x, and Latino /a/x studies, border studies, cultural studies, critical disability studies, critical gender studies, and global racialized and global silenced communities.

As artists, we may ask: how and when does our making become a form of amends?In this class, we will develop our critical thinking skills by exploring the multiple connotations, metaphors, histories, and applications of amends. We will turn to the work of artists, theorists, scientists, farmers, healers, activists, and spiritual practitioners and discuss practices of making amends (such as mending and repurposing; individual apologies or atonement practices in different spiritual contexts; soil amending, river restoration, or community gardens) and different social and political movements focused on amends (such as Restorative and Transformative Justice, Reparations, and Land Back.) We will study how amends are practiced at an individual, collective, and global scale and consider how these practices might offer useful metaphors and strategies for our own lives and creative praxis.Through close reading and active response to cultural texts and phenomena drawn from multiple disciplines and reflecting diverse perspectives, we will work with a transdisciplinary methodology reading across and between different disciplines, projects, and movements looking for useful juxtapositions that help us develop our critical capacities.&nbsp;Foundations in Critical Studies introduces critical thinking skills essential to college-level work in the humanities and sciences.

The content of the elective options varies from year to year.Section Description:This elective will explore the many untapped potentials found in architecture that is exceptionally awkward. Defined as lacking the right proportions, proper attributes, or accepted ideals of grace, our shared architectural story is in many ways framed by iconic buildings that fit this description for awkwardness. More importantly, these attributes can be understood as a useful way to challenge conventional approaches to architectural design. Students who are curious about alternative practices, or gravitate towards architects who have found ways to transcend creative and aesthetic boundaries, will have an opportunity to dig deeper into the histories, theories, and methodologies for what we\u2019ll call the \u2018good, the bad, and the ugly\u2019. As we will see, it is often at the margins of the field where design opportunity lurks and the rules of engagement can be more readily challenged. Course content will span from architecture legacies to discussions on contemporary buildings, technologies, and new media. Awkward examples are many: the classic Pantheon intentionally leaks indoors every time it rains, and the facade of St. Mark\u2019s Basilica in Venice is composed with mismatched columns taken from other buildings. Readings will leverage strategies that tap uncharted cultural territories: calling it \u2018no-good architecture\u2019 Atelier Bow-Wow uncovers design sophistication in Tokyo\u2019s anonymous buildings, where already existing combinations defy logic, yet make perfect (and humorous) sense. Architects/theorists Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown assign high disciplinary value to ironic materials, low budgets, and disposable media. And Pritzker Prize architect Wang Shu stacks wall materials with intentional irregularity, disharmony, and a touch of chaos.

Students will be required to write their own stories, to diagram both stories and films, and to be able to talk fluently about craft. Mostly we will be exploring why stories captivate us and what artists, whether they are screenwriters, fiction writers, or non-fiction writer, do to carry us through their narratives. We will discuss how to bring characters alive, how to create tension and how to craft a satisfying ending. We\u2019ll explore too why some stories ultimately disappoint us, what those writers did or didn\u2019t do that let us down. There will be both creative and analytical assignments, including a completed short story and two longer analytical papers.

Students will engage in hands-on exercises that reveal how knowledge is produced through interviewing, observing, and analyzing material artifacts. It will help students understand how to bring together data from different sources to solve problems and achieve greater interpersonal empathy. Students will read ethnographies from various cultures and contexts to appreciate the benefits and challenges of ethnography. The course will consider important issues including: ethics; the influence of the researcher in outcomes; observing the self; emotional labor; decolonizing design; the quantified self; visual ethnography; artistic data collection techniques; and approaches to participatory design. The course heightens awareness of how everyday behavior risks reinforcing inequities or non-optimal designs of products and processes, and how ethnography may help forge a path toward social change.

Students are expected to read complex texts \u2014both fiction and nonfiction\u2014and the work of their peers in order to develop a critical understanding of argument and reason, both in the recognition of the strategies of other texts and the effective management of their own writing. Students must demonstrate the ability to write accurate, coherent, and thoughtful argumentative essays and to integrate academic source material into their writing. To this end, instruction will focus on strategies for organization, development, research, and revision. We will examine writers and artists from various mediums, while exploring the strategies they use to find their \"voice\". Many of these strategies reference mainstream culture in relation to a culture or subculture that has been seen as marginal. Almost all of the writers and artists we will look at this semester engage in comparisons between mainstream \"modern\" Western society and repressed (gay subculture) or formerly repressed cultures and subcultures (colonialism). Some of these comparisons involve critiques of modern Western society. Various strategies are used for such critiques including parody, humor, and comparative framing.Writing 1 is an introduction to college-level writing, reading, and discussion.
