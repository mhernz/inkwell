In this course, you will explore animation&#39;s convergence with sculpture and installation art. Beyond conventional single-screen films, we delve into experimental storytelling techniques, material manipulation, and the fusion of animation with sculpture. We examine how cinema and materials can convey meaning and emotions beyond linear narratives. You&#39;ll create animations in various formats, spanning digital, traditional (cut-out collage, silhouette animation), and traditional art mediums (charcoal, watercolors, painting, found materials). You will also be exposed to additional media hardware and software technologies for expanding animation and immersive large scale video projection.The course also delves into animation&#39;s role in interdisciplinary visual art and cultural contexts. Ideal for animation, sculpture, and all fine arts and individualized students seeking to expand their practice.Techniques will be taught to expand your practices including basics of animation to non animation majors and basics of installation, sculpture and spatial arts to animation majors.

Form &#43; Space studio examines strategies of making, and the different ways in which we perceive and understand three-dimensional space and the built forms that define it, combining design problems with direct research that uses the city of San Francisco as a laboratory. The course also explores the effect of culture and program on various spatial practices and encourages students engagement with their own bodies as spatial, experiential and cultural referents. Highly recommended for all Architecture and Interior Design students."

Building on canonical understandings of the architectural image and its transformation in the Digital Turn, the course positions the architectural image as a form of data processing, distinct from photography or drawing. As the course builds knowledge in image-manipulation and visualization techniques, regular discussions of cultural visual references, realism and image aesthetics help students develop a critical position in the design of images that support design intent."

Lost in the fire were many homes and commercial buildings, but also many businesses and employment opportunities, and the community is challenged with replacing both its physical and economic infrastructures. In this seminar, we will first survey the current state of mass timber building approaches, and then use that growing sector of building design and construction as the lens for developing timber-related building products and systems that will help rebuild the economic base for Greenville and similar timber-based communities. Students will work in small teams to design and propose timber products and related entrepreneurial opportunities based on the material and human resources of the community, and at the same time contribute to the larger challenge of expanding the mass timber offerings in the building industry supply chain. This seminar is part of an ongoing series of building technology seminars exploring mass timber building systems, and examining the environmental and economic advantages of using wood over concrete, steel and other alternatives. A complementary Integrated Studio offered this semester by the same instructor will also involve a  project in the community of Greenville, and on applications of  mass timber construction.

More specifically, this course will critically investigate legibility and representation in architecture through historical and formal analyses, contemporary design techniques, and methods of integration into practice. We can begin by saying that legibility in architecture requires both visual clarity of a building\u2019s appearance such that its formal, spatial, and material compositions can be comprehended, as well as a certain clarity of its social, cultural, and political histories. While the term legibility carries a connotation of conclusiveness or objective qualifications, legibility in the context of architecture is most often inconclusive and unresolved. We can also say, or perhaps debate, that representation is at the core of what architects do, and therefore we must go beyond the understanding of representation as merely the production of drawings, models, and renderings for the purposes of depicting your idea. Thus, the interrelations between legibility and representation are crucial to forming a critical practice of engaged architecture, yet they are fraught with ambiguity; ambiguity that is ripe with critical and creative possibilities in architectural history, theory, and design. This course will primarily consist of faculty led lectures and discussions, complimented by some readings, videos, short student presentations, and the production of a series of images and/or models. Less of a note-taking class and more of a routinized, weekly social encounter, the primary, mandatory, unwavering prerequisite is that each student must come prepared to actively engage in discourse, debate, and dialogue \u2013 And must also carry this ethos over to your other classes and divisional culture at CCA.",

The content of the elective options varies from year to year.SECTION DESCRIPTION<br>This seminar is offered to students interested in the relationships between architectural history, theory, and design. More specifically, this course will critically investigate legibility and representation in architecture through historical and formal analyses, contemporary design techniques, and methods of integration into practice. We can begin by saying that legibility in architecture requires both visual clarity of a building\u2019s appearance such that its formal, spatial, and material compositions can be comprehended, as well as a certain clarity of its social, cultural, and political histories. While the term legibility carries a connotation of conclusiveness or objective qualifications, legibility in the context of architecture is most often inconclusive and unresolved. We can also say, or perhaps debate, that representation is at the core of what architects do, and therefore we must go beyond the understanding of representation as merely the production of drawings, models, and renderings for the purposes of depicting your idea. Thus, the interrelations between legibility and representation are crucial to forming a critical practice of engaged architecture, yet they are fraught with ambiguity; ambiguity that is ripe with critical and creative possibilities in architectural history, theory, and design. This course will primarily consist of faculty led lectures and discussions, complimented by some readings, videos, short student presentations, and the production of a series of images and/or models. Less of a note-taking class and more of a routinized, weekly social encounter, the primary, mandatory, unwavering prerequisite is that each student must come prepared to actively engage in discourse, debate, and dialogue \u2013 And must also carry this ethos over to your other classes and divisional culture at CCA."

While much of the work will be generated on the computer, the ultimate goal is to utilize contemporary production tooling to create physical objects in a variety of media. Throughout the course of the semester we will learn the skills needed in 2D and 3D software to output to the LaserCutter, CNC Router and 3D Printer. We will then develop techniques to be able to present our concepts and resolved objects in digital and printed formats. This class will have a strong focus on craft and the making process. Students will be expected to bring their expertise in the building processes of their major to help influence the quality of the finished objects we create. Everyone will be exposed to new media and production processes, and we will foster an exciting environment to experiment and create new works in a multitude of techniques, scale and media."

Through a focus on Black feminist, queer, and diaspora poets from marginalized identities, this course also seeks to illuminate emergent styles and experimental methods in poetic writing, in other words: hybrids. This class aims to teach students traditional approaches to poetry and prose while exposing them to alternative styles of writing. Students are encouraged to develop new modes of poetic expression that mix and meld emergent techniques as well as imagine entirely new forms. We will explore the work of Black feminist literary classics like June Jordan, Lucille Clifton, James Baldwin, and Audre Lorde, diaspora poets like Ocean Vuong, Fatimah Asghar, Yrsa Daley-Ward, and Kazim Ali, as well as up-and-coming local poets like Alan Pelaez Lopez, Ra Malika Imhotep, Tongo Eisen Martin, and fahima ife. By the end of the course, students will have a portfolio length collection of edited poems suitable for submissions to poetry contests, chapbook prizes, writing grants, and other types of artist competitions. Students will learn constructive, effective methods for critiquing and improving their writing practices via activities such as collective readings, free writing, class discussions, small group critique sections, and one-on-one peer review. Suitable for writers of all stages and experience levels. You will be guided with prompts, examples, and collective feedback sessions.",

Through a focus on Black feminist, queer, and diaspora poets from marginalized identities, this course also seeks to illuminate emergent styles and experimental methods in poetic writing, in other words: hybrids. This class aims to teach students traditional approaches to poetry and prose while exposing them to alternative styles of writing. Students are encouraged to develop new modes of poetic expression that mix and meld emergent techniques as well as imagine entirely new forms. We will explore the work of Black feminist literary classics like June Jordan, Lucille Clifton, James Baldwin, and Audre Lorde, diaspora poets like Ocean Vuong, Fatimah Asghar, Yrsa Daley-Ward, and Kazim Ali, as well as up-and-coming local poets like Alan Pelaez Lopez, Ra Malika Imhotep, Tongo Eisen Martin, and fahima ife. By the end of the course, students will have a portfolio length collection of edited poems suitable for submissions to poetry contests, chapbook prizes, writing grants, and other types of artist competitions. Students will learn constructive, effective methods for critiquing and improving their writing practices via activities such as collective readings, free writing, class discussions, small group critique sections, and one-on-one peer review. Suitable for writers of all stages and experience levels. You will be guided with prompts, examples, and collective feedback sessions.",

How can we create images powerful enough to create a bright future for everyone? For whom does this kind of freedom exist?Though readings and films will be recommended and queer art herstory will be examined (and critiqued), the focus here is on making. Each artist will be called upon to not only create a set of artworks but will be asked to present a solid concept, research, and writings in support of each illustrated work. Possibilities include: theater sets, paintings, drawings, costumes, posters, zines, mural designs, pop-up books, comics, and 3-D objects. Everyone is welcome here.",

With their help, we raise and discuss questions about how people experience embodiment; how we negotiate our embodied interactions with others; and how those negotiations intersect with larger cultural configurations, paying special attention to creative practices that emerge from and elaborate on embodied experience. We look at variances of embodiment in a culturally diverse world and cover controversial subjects related to the intersections of nationality, race, ethnicity, gender, class, ability, sexuality, and gender identity/expression as a means to stimulate critical thinking that help to generate discussion. Because this is an online course, we also explore these topics in relation to virtual embodiment and questions of proximity, temporality, and affect. Critical thinking is the active, persistent, and careful consideration of a belief or form of knowledge, the grounds that support it, and the conclusions that follow. It involves analyzing and evaluating one&#39;s own thinking and that of others. Critical thinking usually rests on reading and written communication skills, on scientific method, or on some combination of both. In this online course we strive for an embodied, as well as an intellectual, understanding of our central theme as we pay close attention to our own bodies and the bodies around us, both flesh-bound and virtual.</span>Foundations in Critical Studies introduces critical thinking skills essential to college-level work in the humanities and sciences. Students develop their critical capacities through close reading and active response to cultural texts and phenomena drawn from multiple disciplines and reflecting diverse perspectives on major themes or topics in contemporary life."

We will be thinking about how the creation, management, and narratives around landscapes impact our perception.</span><br /><span>We will be discussing historical formations of space as well as their contemporary consequences, and addressing themes including demographics, city planning, identity, culture, and how systems of power are enacted and contested through spatial arrangements. You will be engaging these topics through a variety of texts and mediums, and thinking about the concept of mapping space through engaging models of how people have made sense of space through visualizations. Throughout this course you will create your own \u201ccritical map\u201d that will allow you to interrogate how we understand and interact with space.</span>Foundations in Critical Studies introduces critical thinking skills essential to college-level work in the humanities and sciences. Students develop their critical capacities through close reading and active response to cultural texts and phenomena drawn from multiple disciplines and reflecting diverse perspectives on major themes or topics in contemporary life."

The class analyzes how historical positions regarding the natural environment as an untamed expanse or \u201cformless substance to be molded into whatever shape we desire\u201d (Katz) persist along with contemporary discourses on conservation, entanglement, kinship, etc.  It also examines the increasing understanding of \u2018encapsulations of and within nature,\u2019 from 19th c. awareness of pollution, to NASA\u2019s first image of the globe, to countless bounded forms varying in scale, degree of human control, and produced after effects.  Creative practice consistently responds to contemporaneous cultural and scientific understandings of the environment.  Engaging current environmental discourses and crises, contemporary practices experiment with methodological approaches, agenda, and altered roles, producing works ranging from populist forms of environmental advocacy, experimental archiving/curating, the \u2018production of wildness,\u2019 speculative environmental futures, critical uses of data visualization, hybrid technological/environmental performance/cultivation and critique, reconsiderations of the aesthetic representation of environment, etc.  Half-seminar, half workshop, bi-weekly reading discussions analyze environment discourses and modes of creative environmental practice.  Alternate bi-weekly sessions are devoted to the development of individual creative projects.  An analysis of one-two creative practices or methods will inform the development of a singular speculative work (a drawing, a mixed media representation, a model, a short film, a text, an app schematic, etc.).  To stimulate dialogue, student projects are encouraged (but not mandated) to use a common setting/site.  One or two museum or site field trips will be required, and guest speakers are planned.  The class is designed for, and has been most compelling with, cross-disciplinary dialogue.  Students from any graduate program are encouraged to enroll.",

Students investigate how theorists and artists address the complex intersections of race, sexuality, gender, class, health, and nationality in light of subjects such as immigration, transnational media, diasporic communities, disidentification, belonging, and desire. Special attention is given to critical and visual perspectives that challenge monolithic views of identity. Instead we privilege diverse, multiple, and intersectional approaches that connect lived experience, social critique, and artistic practice. This course focuses on cultural diversity, critical analysis, and visual literacy. Students also sharpen their research, verbal communication, and writing skills. Students will develop a general understanding of visual and critical studies in relation to theories of identity and difference, hone skills for analyzing culture from a visual and critical perspective, and focus on a final research project and class presentation using principles of visual and critical studies.",

We can begin by saying that legibility in architecture requires both visual clarity of a building\u2019s appearance such that its formal, spatial, and material compositions can be comprehended, as well as a certain clarity of its social, cultural, and political histories. While the term legibility carries a connotation of conclusiveness or objective qualifications, legibility in the context of architecture is most often inconclusive and unresolved. We can also say, or perhaps debate, that representation is at the core of what architects do, and therefore we must go beyond the understanding of representation as merely the production of drawings, models, and renderings for the purposes of depicting your idea. Thus, the interrelations between legibility and representation are crucial to forming a critical practice of engaged architecture, yet they are fraught with ambiguity; ambiguity that is ripe with critical and creative possibilities in architectural history, theory, and design. This course will primarily consist of faculty led lectures and discussions, complimented by some readings, videos, short student presentations, and the production of a series of images and/or models. Less of a note-taking class and more of a routinized, weekly social encounter, the primary, mandatory, unwavering prerequisite is that each student must come prepared to actively engage in discourse, debate, and dialogue \u2013 And must also carry this ethos over to your other classes and divisional culture at CCA.",

As students identify constituent components of the commons through texts from within and outside of our discipline, case studies of historical, contemporary, and utopian commons projects will be analyzed through drawings and diagrams with specific attention to the scale and visibility of various commons types. In a final project, the course will collaborate with the community group \u201cthe Haight Street Commons\u201d, a network of over 70 domestic communities in San Francisco. Building on the work of Neeraj Bhatia\u2019s Forming Life in Common seminar in the fall, students will consider the design, scale, and visibility of a distributed and networked urban commons.",

Sparked by a loss of confidence in the state as the steward of resources and the free market as provider of goods and services, today\u2019s interest in the commons is rooted in their promise of alternative ownership models, fair collective governance, and a more equitable distribution of spatial and material resources.

Assignments explore the creative potential of basic code, from visual composition to typography to interactivity. While this course has a formal emphasis, we will critically examine the web through historical, political, and social lenses. We will also explore off-screen implementation of code concepts in printed and installation works.</span></p>",

Whether you\u2019re looking for full-time, part-time, freelance, or contracting opportunities, the Designing Your Career (DYC) class will walk you through the entire career design journey\u2014from learning how to communicate who you are (and your \u201cbrand\u201d) publicly to what to expect during your first 90 days at a job. Various themes that we\u2019ll examine together will also act as a useful bridge between your Communication by Design (Fall) and Leadership by Design (Summer) courses.

The design of systems is about mapping the flow of interactions and context, exploring the possible inputs and outputs, and crafting a design response that is useful, appropriate and robust. Through the design of user scenarios, information flows, schematics, wireframes and functional specifications, students will learn the importance of information architecture and thorough systematic thinking for effective navagation, searching, and exploration of information. Students will also gain an understanding of the differences and synergies between design and the organization of information as well as the ability to evaluate and analyze the success of a system to achieve the intended goals. Beyond information systems, students will learn how to begin to apply systems thinking to complex human systems."

In addition, systems-thinking is giving us tools to address complex challenges where there are only responses rather than solutions. In the Systems course, students explore the dynamics of simple and complex systems as well as the design of systems, information and interface for human use. Complex systems have many actors and dependencies that are inherently dynamic in constant change, and they can only be understood by description of their connections. The design of systems is about mapping the flow of interactions and context, exploring the possible inputs and outputs, and crafting a design response that is useful, appropriate and robust. Through the design of user scenarios, information flows, schematics, wireframes and functional specifications, students will learn the importance of information architecture and thorough systematic thinking for effective navagation, searching, and exploration of information. Students will also gain an understanding of the differences and synergies between design and the organization of information as well as the ability to evaluate and analyze the success of a system to achieve the intended goals. Beyond information systems, students will learn how to begin to apply systems thinking to complex human systems.",

Students investigate how theorists and artists address the complex intersections of race, sexuality, gender, class, health, and nationality in light of subjects such as immigration, transnational media, diasporic communities, disidentification, belonging, and desire. Special attention is given to critical and visual perspectives that challenge monolithic views of identity. Instead we privilege diverse, multiple, and intersectional approaches that connect lived experience, social critique, and artistic practice. This course focuses on cultural diversity, critical analysis, and visual literacy. Students also sharpen their research, verbal communication, and writing skills. Students will develop a general understanding of visual and critical studies in relation to theories of identity and difference, hone skills for analyzing culture from a visual and critical perspective, and focus on a final research project and class presentation using principles of visual and critical studies.",

                        "The politics of identity continues to be a compelling and hotly debated topic in visual culture. This course explores the construction, negotiation, and contestation of identity and difference in visual and critical studies. The theoretical scope of this course includes postcolonial theory, race theory, gender studies, and whiteness studies. Students investigate how theorists and artists address the complex intersections of race, sexuality, gender, class, health, and nationality in light of subjects such as immigration, transnational media, diasporic communities, disidentification, belonging, and desire. Special attention is given to critical and visual perspectives that challenge monolithic views of identity. Instead we privilege diverse, multiple, and intersectional approaches that connect lived experience, social critique, and artistic practice. This course focuses on cultural diversity, critical analysis, and visual literacy. Students also sharpen their research, verbal communication, and writing skills. Students will develop a general understanding of visual and critical studies in relation to theories of identity and difference, hone skills for analyzing culture from a visual and critical perspective, and focus on a final research project and class presentation using principles of visual and critical studies."

The symposium groups graduating students into thematic panels moderated by prominent scholars representing relevant fields. MP 2 offers professional training in writing, revising, and editing for publication and prepares students in the arts of formal, conference-style presentation. Having successfully completed MP1, students will receive an M.A. or Dual Degree upon completion of MP2. The MP2 instructor(s) and the VCS Chair will evaluate the student\u2019s overall academic performance during a Final Review at the end of the spring semester."

The course emphasizes research, evaluation and interpretation of written content, typographic details, graphic refinement, aesthetic consistency, intention, and audience. This course answers the following questions: What are the graphic and typographic options for visualizing information and data? What factors must the designer consider when choosing one form of information communication over another? How can the designer maximize effective access to and enhance understanding of complex visual information through the use of rigorously considered and consistent typography and graphic approaches? How does an information-dense communication live as a design element within its broader context and forms (print, web, apps, or the built environment)?"

                        "<span>Dada changed and continues to change the role of art in the world. Begun in 1916 in a cafe in neutral Switzerland by pacifist emigre artists trying to escape the draft into WWI in their own countries, Dada spread like a plague through Europe, the U.S., Japan, and other parts of the globe. This highly political &#34;anti-movement&#34; art movement challenged convention, disrupted the status quo, and questioned the border between art and &#34;the rest of the world.&#34; This course focuses on the subversive strategies of Dada artists, performers, philosophers, and social activists. Students will examine not only the Dada origins of the strategies of subversion in a wide array of media, they will also explore the continued and varied use of Dada&#39;s strategies by later twentieth and twenty-first century artists, thinkers, and world-changers like Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Merce Cunningham and John Cage, to name a few. The class will be much enriched by the various events organized in November by San Francisco&#39;s famed City Lights Bookstore to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of Dada. Featuring some of the leading scholars on the movement, the lectures, multi-media performances, and poetry readings will be an essential component of the class.</span>HAAVC 3000 seminars continue developing students&#39; visual analysis and research skills while providing students the opportunity for in-depth study of the visual/structural artifacts associated with a particular topic, region, or movement. Students will also engage with the relevant primary/secondary literature for the specific topic/theme. Courses will pay particular attention to the larger cultural, historical, and theoretical/ideological contexts in which the visual artifacts and structures under consideration were created. This course cannot fulfill the HAAVC 2000 requirement."

It begins with sketching foundations and perspective construction (line weight, composition, basic layout, lighting) and and continues with freehand shading, color rendering techniques, and introduction to digital sketching and rendering (Photoshop, tablet basics). Instructors will give weekly demonstrations of materials, techniques and visualization followed by assignments designed to develop these skills. Feedback on each student&#39;s design process and abilities will be provided through individual desk crits with the instructor as well as group presentations and critiques. Skills introduced: sketching, perspective drawing, shading, color rendering, 2D form, digital rendering, visual fluency, media techniques, visual presentation, oral presentation, individual and group critique. Software: Photoshop, tablet."

Design Communication 2 is typically taken the first year in the ID program (sophomore year). Students will draw from real source material as well as concept and imagination to quickly and effectively communicate their ideas. Students will learn orthographic hand drawing and rendering (precise annotation, translating physical assets and photographic references into graphic representations) with pencil, pen, and marker, as well as 2D digital drawing and rendering (Illustrator, Photoshop, basic technical package for manufacturing, storyboarding), and advanced digital sketching (tablet, Cintiq). Instructors give weekly demonstrations of materials, techniques and visualization followed by assignments designed to develop each student&#39;s individual skills. This class requires a large number of assignments due for each class period. Skills introduced: orthographic drawing, composition, digital drawing. Skills reinforced: hand and digital rendering, 2D form, visual fluency, visual stylization. Software and tools: Illustrator, Photoshop, tablet, Cintiq."

DF1 is typically taken the first year in the ID program (sophomore year). The class is divided between two different modeling programs - Rhino and Solidworks (parametric 3D modeling). Students will learn how to output their work from each software to Keyshot (3D rendering), 3D rapid prototypes, and 2D output (specification packages; color, material, and finish presentations). Instructors will give weekly demonstrations of the software techniques and capabilities. Feedback on each student's design process and abilities will be provided through individual desk crits with the instructor as well as group presentations and critiques.

Beginning with the late 19th century English Arts and Crafts movement students study the ideas, individuals and institutions behind the leading movements in modern design. Topics include Arts &amp; Crafts, Art Nouveau, Art and Engineering, the Bauhaus, the emergence of American Industrial Design as a profession, design in post-war Italy, Germany, Japan and the United States, late 20th century Postmodernism, and will conclude with a survey of the state of the profession today. Examples are drawn from industrial products, architectural spaces, graphic images and information systems with a strong emphasis on the cultural context, philosophy, psychology, politics and the arts. Ultimately students will find that the history of design is not only about objects, but more importantly about ideas. Course material includes lectures, class discussion, and writing assignments. Skills reinforced: materials, manufacturing, design research, history of ID, meaning/semantics, design writing."

Many new challenges will be addressed - the theoretical, strategic, and tactical lessons that students have been learning will evolve and extend to work in these new situations. The students&#39; will work to develop an expanded personal perspective, without losing sight of people and their needs. The roles of sensing the environment and people&#39;s actions in it, the use of actuators and system agency, and new indications of system state will explored with an intention of deep understanding. A series of explorations will be undertaken to establish and exercise a command of the potential that these systems represent. The student will learn to produce simple prototypes using LCD screens, buttons and haptic components and other elements limited only by the student&#39;s imagination and resources. This course includes basic information on sensor technology and electronics. Group projects will be employed to bring the students onto a level playing field in terms of familiarity with the various making skills required for work of this sort. A large-scale project, done in groups, is intended to push on the students&#39; collaboration skills. The course required prerequisites are programing and physics with electronics.",

The roles of sensing the environment and people's actions in it, the use of actuators and system agency, and new indications of system state will explored with an intention of deep understanding. A series of explorations will be undertaken to establish and exercise a command of the potential that these systems represent. The student will learn to produce simple prototypes using LCD screens, buttons and haptic components and other elements limited only by the student's imagination and resources. This course includes basic information on sensor technology and electronics. Group projects will be employed to bring the students onto a level playing field in terms of familiarity with the various making skills required for work of this sort. A large-scale project, done in groups, is intended to push on the students' collaboration skills. The course required prerequisites are programing and physics with electronics.</p>",

Projects generally include: creating a personal online presence with case studies and sample work; using social media as a networking tool for connecting with contacts and advisors; IxD skills assessment (self and professional designers); and identifying skill, career, market, and industry opportunities to help plan for career growth and evolution. By focusing on their professional practice, students develop greater confidence in their work, are better equipped to leverage their skills & interests, and increase their enjoyment of all their processes.This course is integrated with the IxD Junior Review process, which provides students with feedback on their work from working professionals and helps the student identify areas of growth in their interaction design knowledge, process, and craft. Junior Review also ensures the student has demonstrated growth in the concepts and craft of interaction design (core interaction principles, human-centered design practices) and determines if the student has the appropriate understanding and skillset to proceed successfully to their senior year.",

                        "In a poetry anthology I edited long time ago, I quoted acclaimed Mexican poet Jos\u00e9 Emilio Pacheco, who compared monolingualism to living in a fish tank: \u201cWithout translations we would suffocate.\u201d As soon as we step out of that fish tank, we risk a symbolic death for the world sometimes does not have the resources to provide us with the oxygen of our native tongues. While this statement holds a kind of poetic truth, it is obvious that the common citizen of the planet does not have the resources, the time, or the ability to learn all available languages. Since the very beginning of what we now know as \u201cthe novel\u201d the impulse to translate has been as strong as the desire to share with others what we like and admire in the books we read. When Cervantes published Don Quijote de La Mancha in 1604, he probably had no idea that within eighteen years his book would be translated into three languages: English (1612), French (1614), and Italian (1622); most likely the work of excited bilingual readers eager to share with others their discovery. Think for a second how extraordinary this process must have been with the technology proper of the seventeenth century.In this seminar we will study the work a few international authors whose works have made a great<br />impression on readers and other writers across the world. I have chosen to read authors who write in four languages: Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish. I will propose several approaches to the reading of these works and will always keep in mind that this is a dialogue between makers. Texts might include works by Osamu Dazai, Eileen Chang, Mariama Ba, Yu Hua, Emmanuel Carrere, and Pola Oloixarac.LITPA 200 courses introduce students to the study of literature or the performing arts, emphasizing analysis of both particular works and of the range of genres, periods and traditions. Frequent reading and writing assignments will be made."

While our goal will be to craft and polish our draft to narrate your senior project, we will be employing all four of these modes: listening, reading, speaking and writing, as we draft, revise, and polish our writing projects toward completion.</span>Writing &amp; Research in the Discipline courses engage with the writing and research skills relevant to the particular discipline at an advanced, upper-division level. The course will be closely linked to the upper-division work in the major program. Frequent writing assignments."

                        "<span>The ultimate forces for human conflict and cooperation are addressed and contested at the global level. This course calls on the discipline of international relations theory and practice (IR) to clarify ways in which critical themes of world politics such as health, environment, crime and human rights are addressed. Utilizing mainly perspectives drawn from the one unquestioned superpower today, the United States of America, the course studies the role of multinational corporations, international organizations, and international law, as well as ethical forces such as transnational environmentalism at play. From traditional tools of diplomacy and interstate adjudication to modern means available through social media and solidarity movements, the course also envisages possible solutions and alleviations of the human condition.</span>Philosophy and Critical Theory (PHCRT) courses focus on developing critical reading and thinking skills, with an emphasis on learning to frame and explore meaningful questions. Students consider multiple perspectives and claims in the process of formulating independent, well-founded opinions."

                        "The book is a hand-held technology that has completely transformed human culture. Bookworks brings together the many craft, art, and design practices that are integral to making books. This studio class integrates a range of media and materials, content, sequences, and structures into one movable, tactile object. Projects incorporate each artist's interests and work inventively with a variety of traditional and experimental book forms. We will refine our making skills alongside investigations of the book as an expressive place for form and content through storytelling, personal narrative, curatorial impulses, and commentary on broader cultural and political conditions of contemporary life. This class draws equally from Bay Area book art history within the California Arts and Crafts Movement, and the exuberant resurgence of DIY and self-publishing in contemporary art.\u00a0\u00a0From folded accordions and Japanese bindings, to hardcover casebound books and transformative box constructions, Bookworks 1 covers hands-on skills, techniques, and personal narrative development. Weekly demonstrations and individual projects guide students through experimentation and towards a comprehensive body of artwork in the book form. The class includes an introduction to letterpress printing with handset type and polymer plates, artist multiples and editioning, text and image sequencing, with field trips and special collection visits to view historical and contemporary book art works. Open to beginning and advanced students from any major."

In this course, students will learn to write computer code, building new tools that enable new ways of thinking about, exploring, and understanding the world. Specific topics vary by instructor and may include abstraction, iteration, hierarchy, data modeling, simulation, visualizing data, designing systems, and debugging programs. These concepts will be introduced and reinforced using common programming languages and other foundational technologies in common professional use. A final project requires that students develop a relative depth of expertise in those technical areas touched by the project. High school level competence in algebra is assumed.As part of the 2000-level Science and Math (SCIMA) curriculum, this course develops students' capacity for evidence-based reasoning and their ability to recognize and interpret meaningful patterns of information; to assess the validity of empirical claims, distinguishing between opinion and fact; and to understand the sociocultural relevance of scientific and mathematical thinking.",

Energy Star ratings for appliances? Is there such a thing as a process with no waste? Why are renewable energy schemes tied to fossil fuels, and can they be untied? Is there a criterion for examining the sustainability of processes such as making ethanol biofuel from corn? What about impacts of such processes outside the energy market, such as on the food market? Is local food always better? Is there truth to the notion that Native Americans have always lived lightly upon the land? Why was Easter Island abandoned? What is our responsibility to current and future generations? Is there a sustainable future in the face of unlimited population growth? Can technology save us? Was Malthus right? Through examinations of historical and current case studies and topics and hands-on assignments, we will investigate these and related topics, to find our way to an idea of sustainability based on sound science and ethical behavior.</span></div>Science and Math (SCIMA) courses develop students&#39; capacity for evidence-based reasoning through the study of life, earth, and physical sciences and of computational and theoretical mathematics.

Once plied into linear elements, participants will develop and execute a piece of woven cloth through the use of floor looms. Critical thinking around animal welfare, complex weave structures, and the material specificity of fiber selection will be emphasized.

Students are encouraged to bring their existing material knowledge to the investigations, which could take the form of computers and software to generate work, or experimental\u00a0uses of other materials like ceramic, paint, textiles or metal.</span>Upper Division Interdisciplinary Studios extend a student&#39;s cross-school experience from Core Studio up into their upper division years. 3 units of Interdisciplinary Studio are required of all majors and must be completed in the junior or senior year. This advanced level studio is thematic in nature. Technical demonstrations are paired with thoughtful readings, seminar discussions and ambitious projects. Collaboration, experimentation and presentation skills are developed in concert with critical thinking."

                        "Life Stories, will focus mainly on personal essays and narratives. We will read authors from<br />many different backgrounds who write about themselves or others from a personal perspective. The selection of texts will cover an assortment of styles and perspectives that will help the students understand that reading is a process of assimilation and imitation, an exploration of possibilities and options, and a path to personal epiphanies. It is my hope that these texts will help all of us to see the world with a greater sense of the other. At the same time, we will work throughout the term to improve our writing skills to be able to convey in more effective way our thoughts and our emotions as makers of creative objects. Texts will include works written by journalists, poets, fiction writers, and academics from several national backgrounds.Writing 2 continues the work begun in Writing 1 on strengthening students&#39; ability to write, read and discuss at the college level, with emphasis on literary and visual analysis, and research and argumentation skills. The course will revolve around a specific theme selected by the instructor."

We\u2019ll explore the history and critical languages of genre fiction, do all sorts of generative writing and revision exercises, and become better readers, writers and critics of each other\u2019s work.</span>Literary Forms courses are designed for Writing and Literature Majors and Minors and are focused on a specific genre, medium, form, or technique specific to their disciplines. Lit Forms courses might focus on a genre (fiction, SF, poetry, CNF, etc.) or might focus on a technique (i.e. dialogue, character, setting, image, research). Literary Forms classes explore similarities and differences across mediums and genres, involve reading and writing, and multi-modal approaches to critical inquiry including creative responses. Literary Forms courses typically balance seminar and workshop activities."
